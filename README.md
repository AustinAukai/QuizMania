**Quiz Mania**

Practicing math can at times be boring and our team wanted to create an app that would change this. Introducing Quiz Mania. This app is an online multiplayer game that allows kids to practice their math skills.

How to use this app
  - Create an account and log into the web app.
  - Once you are logged in and ready to play you will be put in the game lobby.
  - The app will then match you up with another player and give you a count down to game start.
   - Once the game starts, basic arithmetic problems will fall down the screen and you will have to answer them as quick as possible.
   - There are a total of 10 questions per game and the person who gets the most questions right is the winner.
